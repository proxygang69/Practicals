W9.Create your own webpage using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap called "index.html". 
It should have: 
●  A title 
●  Three or more types of headings 
●  Some paragraphs 
●  One or more ordered lists 
●  One or more unordered lists 
●  One Or More Tables 
●  Some line-breaks 
●  Some horizontal lines 
●  Some comments 
●  Various text styles: bold, italic, strike-through, underline 
Make sure that the file is reasonable large: 2-3 screen worth at least. (You can 
add dummy content if you wish). 
●  View the above HTML file on a browser, using a URL such as: 
●  http://localhost/index.html OR double click on html file. 
●  Learn to look at the HTML source from the browser window. 
●  Now create some internal bookmarks and links using the "name=xyz" 
property and "href=#xyz". 
Type the URLs for these internal bookmarks directly onto the browser. 
●  Now move all the HTML files to another directory. Your links should still work (they should 
be relative links). 
●  Now include some styles within HTML tag elements. For example: table border, cell 
background, link colour, text colour, background colour, list style, text font, etc. 
●  Now include some of the earlier styles in the "style" tag of the HTML "head" section, 
instead of marking the styles in individual HTML tag elements. 
●  Now have a separate css file for the above styles, so that the same can be included in 
multiple HTML files.
