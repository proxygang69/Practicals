# Welcome, Traveler 🌍

Take a seat, clone the repo, and pray it compiles.  
This is your last hope. This is the failsafe.  
It exists solely to convince your examiner you did something. Anything.

## How to Run This ⚡

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/proxygang69/Practical.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the dev server (don’t forget to get into the correct directory):

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Requirements Installation 🛠️

Before running, make sure you’ve got the necessary tools installed:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```

```bash
pip3 install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib statsmodels seaborn nltk mlxtend
```

## What It Does 🧐

- Starts up instantly (if the stars align).
- Works just enough to confuse the examiner into passing you.
- Minimalist in nature — embrace the silence.

## Common Errors & Interpretations ⚠️

- **Module not found** – You forgot to install the requirements.
- **Port already in use** – You’ve summoned this app twice.
- **White screen of death** – Check the console. Then fix a typo.
- **Nothing happens** – That’s... kinda the point? Minimalism is an aesthetic.

## If You’re Reading This During a Practical ⏳

Godspeed, soldier. You’re doing great. Kinda.
